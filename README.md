# Employee-Database-Management

## INTRODUCTION

In this database management task, the goal is to create a database named 'Staff' to efficiently manage information about employees. Two tables, 'Employee_Info' and 'Employee_Salary,' are designed with appropriate constraints to organize data related to staff details and their salary information. These constraints ensure data accuracy, consistency, and reliability. The task involves inserting ten rows of information into both tables, and then crafting SQL queries to retrieve specific data. Additionally, table and column renaming, along with changes to data types and the addition of a new column, are performed to enhance the structure and functionality of the database. This task encompasses various aspects of database administration, including schema design, data insertion, querying, and schema modification, contributing to the effective management of employee information within the 'Staff' database.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT


Problem Statement:
1. Create a comprehensive database named 'Staff'. Within this database, create two tables, 'Staff_Info' and 'Staff_Salary', with specific constraints to ensure data integrity and accuracy. The structure of the tables should include the following columns:
   - 'Staff_Info' (ID, Name, Age, DOE, Contract_Duration)
   - 'Staff_Salary' (ID, Salary, Yearly_Increment)
2. Insert into 'staff_info' and 'staff_salary' ten (10) rows of informations
3. Construct SQL queries to extract specific details:
   - The Name and Age from the 'Staff_Info' table.
   - The ID and Salary from the 'Staff_Salary' table.
5. Rename the existing tables to 'Employee_Info' and 'Employee_Salary,'
6. Change the 'ID' columns in both table to 'Employee_ID.'
7. Alter the 'Employee_ID' columns data types to 'Text' data types
8. Create a new column named 'Department' in the 'Employee_Salary' table
9. For Employees with the following IDs, update their Departments with the specified
   - IDs 1, 3, 7 = IT
   - IDs 2, 5, 9 = Advertising
   - IDs 4, 6, 8, 10 = Communications
10.
