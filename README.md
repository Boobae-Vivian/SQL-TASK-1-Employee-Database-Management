# Employee-Database-Management

## INTRODUCTION

In this database management task, the goal is to create a database named 'Staff' to efficiently manage information about employees. Two tables, 'Employee_Info' and 'Employee_Salary,' are designed with appropriate constraints to organize data related to staff details and their salary information. These constraints ensure data accuracy, consistency, and reliability. The task involves inserting ten rows of information into both tables, and then crafting SQL queries to retrieve specific data. Additionally, table and column renaming, along with changes to data types and the addition of a new column, are performed to enhance the structure and functionality of the database. This task encompasses various aspects of database administration, including schema design, data insertion, querying, and schema modification, contributing to the effective management of employee information within the 'Staff' database.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT


Problem Statement:
1. Create a comprehensive database named 'Staff'
  - Using the database Staff, create two tables named 'Staff_Info' and 'Staff_Salary', with specific constraints to ensure data integrity and accuracy.

Furthermore, the absence of standardized constraints has led to inconsistencies in the data, making it challenging to enforce rules related to salary ranges (5000-20000) and age ranges (23-40). Additionally, the lack of a systematic approach to data insertion has resulted in difficulties in retrieving specific information about the staff.

The organization is encountering issues in obtaining essential information about the staff, such as their names and ages, which hinders decision-making processes. Moreover, there is a need for a systematic approach to retrieving salary details, specifically the ID and salary information.

To enhance the database structure and naming conventions, there is a necessity to rename the existing tables to 'Employee_Info' and 'Employee_Salary,' along with changing the primary key column names from 'ID' to 'Employee_ID.' Additionally, there is a requirement to alter the data types of the primary key columns to 'Text' for improved compatibility and uniformity.

Lastly, the organization has identified a need to expand the database by incorporating a new column named 'Department' in the 'Employee_Salary' table. The current system lacks this vital information, hindering the ability to associate salary details with specific departments.

In summary, the organization faces challenges related to the absence of a structured database system, inconsistencies in data due to the lack of constraints, difficulties in retrieving essential information, and the need for improvements in database naming conventions and structure. Addressing these issues through the proposed enhancements will contribute to a more efficient and effective employee management system.
